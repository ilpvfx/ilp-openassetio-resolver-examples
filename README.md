# ILP OpenAssetIO Resolver Examples

This repository contains prototype examples demonstrating how to integrate [OpenAssetIO](https://openassetio.github.io/OpenAssetIO/) into various DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools for resolving custom URI-based file paths. These examples serve as starting points for building OpenAssetIO-based workflows in VFX pipelines.
